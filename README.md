## About
This game plays on the dynamics of a girl group, and within this example it is a girl group from South Korean named BlackPink.

Each of the members are assigned a "diva value" that is dynamically assigned to the pictures in javascript.  Each time the user clicks on a picture of the girls, the Diva Score goes up. There is a target diva score that is the main goal of the game.  You want to be able to get to the same score as the "Target Diva Score" to acquire a "Billboard Hit" (which is a win), and if you do not match the scores you will get a "Flop."

The game can go as long as you would like, and the option to reset the entire game is linked at the top of the screen.
